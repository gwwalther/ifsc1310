        <h3>Dragon Revision</h3>
        <p>I had my grandmother review my dragon project. To be fair, I don't know if she was the best person to get feed back on a website from, but my options were limited. There weren't many gripes with the project, but she had troule reading the text, there weren't any pictures, and the history table looked awkward not centered. I did my best to correct these things. </p>
        <p>For the text problem, I switched to a different font with thicker linage so that it was easier to read. This was something I should have considered and would definetly do different if I redid this project. The content I create should be accessable and clear for anyone who views it. The goal with website deisgn is not only to make websites, its to make websites for everyone and I should have thought about that when I made this project. I made the revision though now and I will keep it in mind in the future.</p>
        <p>To minutely solve the picture gripe, I added a png to the bottom of the home page. While this does add a picture, there should still be more probably, but this comes with an issue that I will bring up later. Anyways, the img I added was a png that fit nicely at the bottom that didn't take up to much space and fit nicely with the simplistic retro feel of the site. I think if I were to do this again, I would have done some pixel arts because I think that would have fit better with the overall theme. Pictures are an interactice element in websites that help to keep users ingaged. It also help to divide up text into digestable portions, which can be good if you just have massive blocks of text. On the other hand you can easily have o many images where it just looks sloppy. I want to try and find the balance of pictures to text. I sure it''s not a one size fits all, but there are sure to be some guidelines to help.</p>
        <p>The last issue I fixed was moving the table in the history page to the center. I don't think that this was a major problem wit the site, but more a styleistic or personal preference type issue. While I did this, it made me realise that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to make a website that accomdates for everyone. There will always be someone somewhere that doesn't like x, y, and z about my website, but I shouldn't let that discourage me. As a website designer, I should strive to have the best user friendly site I can, but I shouldn't dwell on everything or take it to heart.</p>
        <p>This project helped me in my web deveoping career. The project taught me bringing not my own ideas together to form a cohesive site. Coding for something you are not well versed in is not as easy as writing code for your own ideas, but it's what you will most likely be doing if you are looking to do web deveopment in the future as a career. This project taught me a few extra thigns to look out for while showing me the progress I have made through this course. There is still much more growth to be had, but these are the stepping stones in the field I want to pursue. </p>

        <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>Looking back over the semester, there are somethings I wish I would have done, but nothing majjor. I have experience in html, css, and javascript from when I was younger. I took two web design courses in highschool which I still remember greatly today. I dont like saying it, but I wish that I wouldn't have let this get to my head and think I was above some asignments. Even if I knew how to do something I still could use the practice, and there were plently of things this course offered that I had never done before like the gravit logo for example. I wish I would have paid a little more attention in some of the lectures because I'm sure I missed somethings (I'm not saying I didn't listen!)</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I am glad to say that there were some things that I did well in this course. I had a retty good grasp on how long it would take me to code something and was able to manage time pretty well. I also was able to know what was goign on and ask questions in class about other languages. For instance, I asked about the application of markdown in our html. It was nice to see the lines connect between class and things I like, and also the primary reason I decided Computer Science as my major.</p>
        <p>All in all, I would recommend this course to any asppiring Computer Science student or even anyone that is just interested in learning to code. HTML is a great stepping stone for coding. CSS and javascript are great additons too with the idea of linking other files to do more work and the logic followed with js. The cource is also easily formatted which is great for people just coming in since the field can be so daunting at first glance. Thank you for your time and all the effort you've put into this course. It really shows. My personal favorite part is the course homepage run by you. It's a nice touch that shows some of the potential in coding in this course and gets the students interested.</p>
